CSS Flexbox, or Flexible Box Layout, is a layout model in CSS that is designed to make it easier to create complex layouts with a more predictable and efficient way than traditional CSS layout methods like floats and positioning. Flexbox is particularly well-suited for distributing space and aligning items in a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic.

Here are the key concepts and properties associated with CSS Flexbox:

1. **Flex Container**: To use Flexbox, you need a container element. This container becomes a "flex container." You designate it as such by applying `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` to the container's CSS.

   ```css
   .flex-container {
     display: flex;
   }
   ```

2. **Flex Items**: The children of the flex container are referred to as "flex items." These items are automatically adjusted to fit the container's size and are what you control with Flexbox properties.

   ```html
   <div class="flex-container">
     <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
     <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
     <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Main and Cross Axis**: Flexbox operates in two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the `flex-direction` property and is the direction in which flex items are laid out, while the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.

4. **Flex Direction**: You can set the direction of the main axis using the `flex-direction` property. It can be set to `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, or `column-reverse`.

   ```css
   .flex-container {
     display: flex;
     flex-direction: row; /* The default value */
   }
   ```

5. **Justify Content**: The `justify-content` property controls how items are distributed along the main axis. It allows you to specify how extra space is distributed or how items are aligned within the container.

   ```css
   .flex-container {
     justify-content: space-between;
   }
   ```

6. **Align Items**: The `align-items` property controls how items are aligned along the cross axis. It determines the vertical alignment of items within the container.

   ```css
   .flex-container {
     align-items: center;
   }
   ```

7. **Flex Items Properties**: Each flex item can have its own properties, like `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`, which determine how they grow and shrink within the container.

   ```css
   .flex-item {
     flex: 1 0 auto; /* flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis */
   }
   ```

8. **Flex Wrap**: By default, flex items are placed in a single line. The `flex-wrap` property allows you to control whether items should wrap onto multiple lines if they don't fit within the container.

   ```css
   .flex-container {
     flex-wrap: wrap;
   }
   ```

9. **Align Content**: When there are multiple lines of items in a flex container, the `align-content` property controls how those lines are spaced within the container.

   ```css
   .flex-container {
     align-content: space-between;
   }
   ```

CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout model that simplifies the creation of responsive and complex layouts, and it's widely used in web development to create more efficient and predictable designs. It works well for both one-dimensional (rows or columns) and two-dimensional layouts.
