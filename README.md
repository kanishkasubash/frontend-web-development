## [HTML From Scratch](https://github.com/kanishkasubash/frontend-web-development/tree/master/html-crash-course)

### HTML

"HTML" stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and provides a structure for the web page that we can style with CSS and create interactions with JavaScript.

In this section, I have learned as much about HTML5 as possible. I have created a sample web page with all the standard HTML5 tags, attributes, semantic markup, etc.

### Basic HTML Template

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Crash Course</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

## [CSS From Scratch](https://github.com/kanishkasubash/frontend-web-development/tree/master/css-crash-course)

### CSS

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to style the frontend of any web page. CSS is a fundamental technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

In this section, I have learned as much as possible about CSS. I have looked at styles, selectors, declarations, etc. I have built a web page with CSS, which I can keep as a resource. I have created a basic website layout. I am using CSS3 but mostly the basics.

### Internal CSS
Using ```<style></style>``` tags within a document

```html
<style type="text/css">
    color: #333;
</style>
```

### External CSS
Linking an external .css file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
```

## [JavaScript From Scratch](https://github.com/kanishkasubash/frontend-web-development/tree/master/javascript-crash-course)

### JavaScript

JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your pages. Common examples you may have seen on the websites are sliders, click interactions, popups, etc.

In this section, I have learned the fundamentals of JavaScript including more modern syntax like classes, arrow functions, etc. This is the starting point of my learning JS.

### Internal JS
Using ```<script></script>``` tags within a document

```html
<style type="text/javascript">
    var i = 10;
</style>
```

### External JS
Linking an external .js file

```html
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```
