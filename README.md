# Frontend Web Development

## How do I learn to code HTML | CSS | JavaScript

Welcome to my Frontend Web Development repository. Through this repository, I learned from scratch to deploy my first full-stack web application. Along the way, I have been learning essential web development concepts needed for now and beyond.

## HTML From scratch

### HTML

"HTML" stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and provides a structure for the web page that we can style with CSS and create interactions with JavaScript.

In this section, I have learned as much about HTML5 as I can. I have created a sample web page with all of the common HTML5 tags, attributes, semantic markup, etc.

### Basic HTML5 Template

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Crash Course</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

## CSS From scratch

### CSS

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to style the frontend of any web page. CSS is a fundamental technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

In this section, I have learned as much as possible about CSS. I have looked at styles, selectors, declarations, etc. I have built a web page with CSS, which I can keep as a resource. I have created a basic website layout. I am using CSS3 but mostly the basics.

### External css link

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
```
