## Learn HTML and CSS

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It is **NOT** a programming language. HTML is a markup language for creating web pages/documents, also the building blocks of the web. CSS stands for "Cascading Stylesheet" and is NOT a programming language. CSS is a stylistic language used to layout and design web pages. In this, I learn HTML and CSS through building and deploying five awesome projects. It is also fully interactive, with over 75 coding challenges.

1. Build & Deploy First Website
2. Build a Google.com Clone
3. Build a Digital Business Card
4. Build a Space Exploration Site
5. Build a Birthday Gift Site
6. Solo Project: Hometown Homepage
